# Tic-Tac-Toe
Learning about Python through implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game for the terminal.

Board can be any size, how nice it looks at bigger sizes depends on the width of your screen.
There can be any number of players.

The game is currently playable!

## Further considerations:
- Currently game breaks if 0 players is selected.
- Do more research on the pythonic way of doing things and adjusting accordingly.
- Mess with colors to make icons easier to distinguish
